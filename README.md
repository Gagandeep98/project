# This is a program where I am using a dataset and performing operations on the .csv file. 
We will have a quick look at the data structure
Calculate the correlation matrix
Find the value counts of the quality attribute
Split the data into training and testing sets 
Print the shape of the training and testing sets
Create a SVM model with the specified hyperparameters 
Train the model on the training set
Use the model to predict the quality of wine on the test set
Print the classification report for the test set
Plot the confusion matrix for the test results
Create two more SVM model with a smaller and larger value of C
Train the model on the training set
Use the model to predict the quality of wine on the test set
Evaluate model1 using cross validation
Print the cross-validation scores and mean of the accuracy scores.
